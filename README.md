The end plan is for the app to mirror NFC tags.  
The main reason for starting this is that I'm curious and bored.

To Do

1. Research android's RFID api and the three NFC modes
2. Mess around with dumping my presto and gym card information on my phone and displaying their payloads
3. Try to have my phone hold onto the card's payload and then broadcast it (Test by running the proof of concept -app 1- on another phone)
4. Work on permanently storing the card's payload to be used later
5. Multiple cards -implement a list-
6. Visually polish
7. maybe implement ads?
8. Make a new google account in order to publish the app (but not have my main account banned for no good reason)
8. Publish to the android app store
