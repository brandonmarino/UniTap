The Purpose of this project is to build a virrtual wallet which contains many virtual NFC tags.  These tags will work in tandem with a terminal allowing the user access to buildings and the ability to make payments and spend loyalty points.

Done
1. Simple NDEF messaging between two devices
2. Simple Wallet to XML exportation
3. Implement encryption on a string
4. Navigation Pane and added simple Material Design style navigator and coloured statusbar/actionbar
